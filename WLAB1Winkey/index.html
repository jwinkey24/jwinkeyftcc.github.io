  <p> Kiyotaka Ayanokōji (綾あやの小こう路じ 清きよ隆たか, Ayanokōji Kiyotaka) is the main protagonist of the You-Zitsu/Classroom Of The Elite series. Kiyotaka is a tall and lean young man with brown hair, brown eyes, and a fair complexion. He is currently a second-year student of Advanced Nurturing High School.

  <p> His father, Atsuomi Ayanokōji, founded an organization named the White Room. The organization focused on creating an advanced system of education for future generation to lead Japan. Some time after founding the organization, he placed his own son into the program and the latter excelled in every course, being Atsuomi's masterpiece and the latter believed that Kiyotaka would be the ruler of Japan in the future. As the father of Kiyotaka, he appears to care and is proud of his son but rather in a view as if he was his creation, a masterpiece that he created rather than in a familial.  </p>

  <h4> First Appearance </h4>

  <p> As early as the anime starts it gives us a glimpse of a little boy in a white room. This young child is presented competing in several different competitons in regards to subjects for schooling, activities such as calligraphy, board games, playing instruments and basic training in hand to hand combat. The character is almost shown with almost no remorse or lack of any type of human behavior, as if he was a tool used to only complete the desires of his father.</p>
